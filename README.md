  Project Structure:

  Servlet will perfrom input validation

  Services will catch any other errors and provide a message to what error is

  Dao will catch errors related to database.

  Each component handles errors only within thier own scope. For example, servlet wont handle missing info from the database 
  since it has no way of knowing what is in the database at that level.
